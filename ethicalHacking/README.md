# INFOs

Unfortunately, during the course, my Linux distro got corrupted, and I had to format everything. I could not recover the material from around the first half of the course, thus most of the scripts/exercises are missing. Even so, I managed to recover the `.pdf` version of my first report, and both `.pdf` and `.md` versions are available for the other.

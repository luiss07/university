# INFOs A.Y. 2023/2024

Unfortunately, during the course, my Linux distro got corrupted, and I had to format everything. I could not recover the material from around the first half of the course, thus most of the scripts/exercises are missing. Even so, I managed to recover the `.pdf` version of my first report, and both `.pdf` and `.md` versions are available for the other.

> P.S.: If someone attending the course finds this repository, and the **report challenges** have not been updated yet (doubt it but who knows), please refrain from plain copy-pasting the reports. I believe that the course is really helpful and fun, and it can be fully appreciated only by swearing on the challenges (welcome to CTFs). Doing the challenges is a great way to learn, and I would not like to spoil that for anyone. 

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me, I will try to help.

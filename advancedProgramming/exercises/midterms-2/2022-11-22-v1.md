# Ex 1
define the Doublable trait with a method `gimme_double`
implement Doublable for i32, `gimme_double` returns a new i32 that is twice self
implement Doublable for String, `gimme_double` returns a new String that is self concatenated with self
implement a function `printdouble` that takes a `Doublable`
and prints the argument and its `gimme_double` using the ":?" formatter
    it behaves as the example:
    doubling 5 is 10
    doubling "what" is "whatwhat"
# Ex 2
Define a struct `Wrapper` that contains a field `v` of type `Vec<i32>`
define an iterator for `Wrapper` to cycle over the elements of the vector
the iterator will skip every other element, effectively accessing only those
at odd index in the inner vector (the first element is at index 0)
# Ex 3
write a function `basicbox_sum` that takes a vector of Strings and returns a vector of Boxes of usizes
the returned vector contains all the lengths of the input vector followed by a final element that sums all the previous lengths
# Ex 4
take the following `List` and `Node` structs
define these functions and methods for `List`, each one defines how many points it yields
    - [7] remove: takes a position `p:i32` where to remove the element from the list
        and it returns a Result<(),String>
        The function removes the node at position `p` or returns the string "wrong position" if
        the list has fewer than `p` elements. That is:
            removing from position `2` in `[10,20,30]` will return `[10,20]`.
            removing from position `3` in `[10,20,30]` will return `Err("wrong position)`
            removing from position `0` in `[10,20,30]` will return `[20,30]`.
    - [2] pop: removes the head of the list
    - [2] pop_last: removes the last element of the list
    - [4] get: takes a position `p` and returns an optional pointer to the `p`th T-typed element in the list
         (That is, a pointer to the element, not a pointer to the Node)
Note: the tests already include the code below, all you need to paste as the answer are the `impl` blocks
and possible imports (use ...).
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct List<T> {
    head: Link<T>,
    len: i32,
}
type Link<T> = Option<Box<Node<T>>>;
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Node<T> {
    elem: T,
    next: Link<T>,
}
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Content {
    s : String, b : bool, i : i32,
}
impl Content {
    pub fn new_with(s:String, b:bool, i:i32) -> Content {
        return Content{s,b,i};
    }
}
```
# Ex 5
SameBool is a Trait

It has a method `samebool` that takes a SameBool and it returns a bool

Content is a struct with an i32 and a bool
Two Contents can be compared (<, >, ==) by comparing their i32 field ([2 points])
Content implements SameBool: the method of the trait returns
    whether `self` has the same bool as the parameter ([1] point)

Define a Graph as a vector of Nodes whose elements are arbitrary T
    - add a function for creating an empty graph ([1] points)
When T implements `SameBool` and `PartialOrd`,
    define function `add_node` that adds a Node to the graph with these connections:
    - the added node gets as neighbour all nodes in the graph that are < than it
    - the added node becomes a neighbour of all the nodes with the `samebool`
    ([6] points)

Note: the tests already include the code below, all you need to paste as the answer are the `impl` blocks
and possible imports (use ... ).
```rust
type NodeRef<T> = Rc<RefCell<Node<T>>>;
    struct Node<T> {
        inner_value: T,
        adjacent: Vec<NodeRef<T>>,
    }
impl<T:Debug> Debug for Node<T>{
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {
        write!(f,"iv: {:?}, adj: {}", self.inner_value, self.adjacent.len())
    }
}
struct Graph<T> {
    nodes: Vec<NodeRef<T>>,
}
pub trait SameBool{
    fn samebool(&self, other:&Self)->bool;

    pub i:i32,
    pub b:bool
}
impl Content {
    pub fn new_with(i: i32, b: bool) -> Content {
        Content { i, b }
    }
}

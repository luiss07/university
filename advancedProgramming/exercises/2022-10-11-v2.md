# Ex 1
## question 1
Will the following code compile?
```
    let x = String::from(”hello”);
    let y = x;
    println!("{}, world!", y);
    println!("{}, world!", x); 
```
- yes
- no, x is moved
- no, x does not implement Display
- no, x is re-borrowed

## question 2
What does this evaluate to?
```
{
    let mut s1 = String::from(“Hello!“);
    {
        let mut s2 = &s1;
        s2.push_str("World!");
        println!("{}", s2)
    }
}
```

- prints: "Hello! World!"
- prints: "Hello!World!"
- prints: "Hello!"
- error 
## question 3
What does this evaluate to?
```
let mut a = 5;
let b = &mut a;
let mut a = 10;
a = 200;
println!(“a: {}, b:{}“,a,b);
```
- print "a: 200, b: 10"
- print "a: 200, b: 200"
- print "a: 200, b: 5"
- error
## question 4
What is printed?
```
fn foo(s: &mut String) -> usize {
    s.push_str("Bob");
    s.len()
}
fn main() {
    let mut s1 = String::from(”Alice”);
    println!("{}",foo(&s1));
}
```

- 5
- 0

## question 5
What is printed?
```
let mut s1 = String::from(“hello”);
{ 
    let s2 = &s1;
    let s3 = &s1;
    let s4 = &mut s1;
    println!(”String is {}”,s1);
    println!(”String is {}”,s2);
    println!(”String is {}”,s3);
    println!(”String is {}”,s4);

}
s1.push_str(“ there”);
println!(”String is {}”,s1);
```

- String is hello
    String is hello
    String is hello
    String is hello
    String is hello there
- String is hello
    String is hello
    String is hello
    String is hello there
    String is hello there
- String is hello there
    String is hello there
    String is hello there
    String is hello there
    String is hello there
- error
## question 6
What does this code print?
```
pub fn main(){
  let mut array = vec![10, 20, 30];
   function(&mut array);
  println!(”{}”, array[0]);
}
fn function(array: &mut Vec<u32>) {
    array[0] = 100;
}
```
- 10, 20, 30
- error
- 10
- 10
## question 7
Owner of str’s data at HERE ?
```
    fn foo(str:String) {
        let x = str; 
        let y = &x;
        let z = x;
        let w = &z;
        // HERE
    }
```
- z
- x
- w
- y

## question 8
What does this code print?
```
fn main() {
  let array = vec![10, 20, 30];
  function(&array);
  println!("{}", array[0]);
}

fn function(array: &Vec<u32>) {
    println!(”{}”, array[0]);
}
```

# Ex 2
write enum A with variants A2 A1, the former takes two chars, the latter three ints
write enum B with variants B1 B2, the former takes 2 ints, the latter a String

write a function `bfroma` that takes an A and then returns a B where B1 has ints that are the index of their A2 counterparts in the alphabet,and B2 has the sting that is the concatenation of the three floats in A1, separated by a -

# Ex 3
write enum Z with variants Y1 Y2, the former takes 2 i32, the latter a bool and a string
write a function `maybesum` that returns the optional sum of the i32's

# Ex 4
write an enum X with 1 variant Y with an i32
write a struct X with 1 field `i` with an i32
use the module system to give the two separate namespaces
the enum's module is called `enumx`, the structs' module is called `structx`

write a function `larger` in another module `modfun` that takes 2 arguments, enum X and struct X
and it returns the larger content of the arguments

# Ex 5
write a `maybesqrt` function that takes a number: i32 and returns an optional i32 value with the result of the square root of the number
// recall .sqrt is a function of f32

# Ex 6
write a `Balance` struct with a field `amt : i32` and a field `active:bool`
Add a `maybericher` method that takes another Balance b and returns true if this one is richer, false if b is richer, unless either Balance is not active

# Ex 7
write a function `nextchar` that takes a char and returns its precedent as i32, in case of 'z' it returns '{ '
// check out what functions `std` offers for `char`

write a function `replwithnext` that takes a string and replaces all its characters with the previous one, unless the string contains a 'z'.
the return should be a result of either the replaced string, or a voir error

# Ex 8
write a struct X with 2 fields s : string and i : i32
write a struct Y with 2 fields z : bool and c : string

give each struct a constructor function `new`. The default values are "xxx", 10 for X and true, "op" for Y.
give each struct a method `getstring` for replacing the string with "", moving the string out of the struct and returning said string
// use std::mem::replace


write a function `swapstr` that takes a X and a Y and then moves s into c and c into s
make D displayable both with :? the formatter as well as with a {} argument in println. With a {} argument, see the example for the result

# Ex 9
write enum C with variants C1, C2, the former takes two i32's, the latter a bool and a string
write struct D with a c field of type C and a s field of type String

give D a function `new` with no parameter that returns a D
give D a function `newfromc` that returns a D given a C, and initialises the s field to the content of C2, or to "not there"
give D a method `larger` that returns the max between the length of s and the multiplication of the enum's two i32
make D displayable both with :? the formatter as well as with a {} argument in println. With a {} argument, see the example for the result

# Ex 10
write a function `swapelconcat` that takes a vector of Strings and 2 indices i, j.
the function returns an optional pointer to the same vector
the function mutates the vector and replaces each element at index i and j with the concatenation of the previous element at position i and j followed by the other element (at position j and i respectively)

# Ex 11
write a function `veclengths` that takes 1 vector of Strings and returns a vector of i32 where an element at position j is the length of the string at position j f the input vector

# Ex 12
write a function `removeelfromvector` that takes a Vector of i32 and a number n: i32 and it removes the first element from the vector whose content can be divided by n without reminder
